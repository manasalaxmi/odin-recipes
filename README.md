# Odin Recipes

Welcome to **Odin Recipes**, a simple recipe website built as part of **The Odin Project** curriculum.

## About This Project

The goal of this project is to build a basic website using only **HTML**. The website consists of a main **index page** that links to a few individual recipe pages. The focus here is not on design, but on building solid foundational skills in structuring web pages with HTML.

Later, this project will be revisited and improved with CSS and other technologies.

## Skills Demonstrated

- Using Git and GitHub for version control
- Creating repositories and managing project files
- Writing semantic, well-structured **HTML**
- Using **relative links** to navigate between web pages
- Organizing project folders

##  Future Improvements

- Add CSS styling for better visual appearance
- Make the website responsive for different screen sizes
- Improve accessibility and SEO
